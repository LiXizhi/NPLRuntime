Turn on the NO_FRAME_RATE_CONTROL flag, the engine will force the card to render as fast as possible,
However, the fluctration of rendering rate will compromise with the simulation engine; the latter is likely to
generate un-smooth animations. The situation is aggravated when V-sync is on.
Turn off this flag, the engine will force the card to run under IDEAL_FRAME_RATE. In most cases, 
we should undefine this flag, unless we want to see the actual FPS for investigation.
