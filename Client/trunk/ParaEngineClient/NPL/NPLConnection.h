	* - when receives an NPL message, it calls the NPLDispatcher to put messages to the correct NPL runtime state's input queue and inform the handler thread. 
	* - When NPL runtime sends an NPL message, the NPLDispatcher will pop the messages from the NPL runtime state's output queue and send it out via the corresponding NPLConnection object.
