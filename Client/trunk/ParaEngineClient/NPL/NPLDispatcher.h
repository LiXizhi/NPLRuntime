	* this class serves as an interface between the low level socket interface and NPL message queues.  
	* - when a socket connection receives an NPL message, it calls the NPLDispatcher to put messages to the correct NPL runtime state's input queue and inform the handler thread. 
	* - When the local NPL runtime sends an NPL message, the NPLDispatcher will create get a connection object that represents the target and then sends out the message. 
	* - when a NPL server accepts a new connection, it will add a new connection to the dispatcher with their sNID. 
	*
	* all handler_xxx functions are called from the dispatcher thread. the dispatching thread is an asynchronous io service for dispatching all messages of all sockets.
