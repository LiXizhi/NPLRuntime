/** @mainpage The Global Landscape Terrain Reference in ParaEngine
*
* @section intro_sec Introduction
*
* The Global Landscape Terrain engine used in ParaEngine.
* The core ROAM algorithm of the terrain engine is based on code from the Demeter Terrain Visualization Library by Clay Fowler, 2002.
* I have ported from its original OpenGl implementation to DirectX. The terrain engine uses ROAM or Real-time Optimally Adapting Meshes algorithm. 

* A global terrain can either be single or latticed. The latter will load terrain as tiles 
* automatically when they are potentially visible.
* a global terrain's world coordinate (x,y) is defined as below:
* x>=0, y>=0. A single terrain usually has less than 512*512 vertices and is suitable for terrain size 
* smaller than 2000*2000meters. A latticed terrain has no theoretical upper limit of terrain size. In a latticed terrain,
* each terrain tile may be 500*500meters(possibly containing 128*128 elevation vertices) and there may be any number of such tiles in the latticed terrain. 
* For example, if 64*64 tiles are available on hard disk, then the total terrain size will be 32000*32000 meters.
* Internally, terrain tile is dynamically loaded into a sorted map. So there finally is an upper limit as for the total
* number of tiles loaded concurrently. But in most cases, only the 9 tiles around the camera position need to be
* loaded for rendering. One can specify how many tiles to be cached in memory. By default it is set to 18.

* For each single terrain tile, main or base texture is automatically broken in to texture tiles (each of size 256*256).
* A common texture is repeatedly(tiling) rendered on another layer on top of base texture. 
* However, the main or base texture does not has enough resolution and, in most cases, is used for rendering terrain in the far side.
* A matrix of high-resolution textures are used to rendering terrain surface near the camera position. For a 500*500 meter terrain.
* there is usually 16*16 number of high-resolution images covering the entire terrain. If the high-resolution texture is absent, the base texture 
* and the common texture is used instead.

The main game engine communicates with the terrain engine through the CGlobalTerrain Class. Global Terrain is loaded
from text based configuration files. There are two kinds of configuration files. See below
- Configuration file for a single terrain. 
- Configuration file for a lattice based terrain.

* @section format_singleconfig File Format: Single Terrain Configuration

A single terrain object can be loaded from a configuration file.
the following file format is expected from the file, pay attention to spaces between characters:

-- The script file to be executed after the terrain is loaded. It is optional.
OnLoadFile = script/loader.lua
-- the height map file,it can either be a gray-scale image or a Para-RAW elevation file.\n
Heightmapfile = texture/data/elevation.raw\n
-- The main or base texture. this is optional.\n
[MainTextureFile = texture/data/main.jpg]\n
-- The common texture. this is optional.\n
[CommonTextureFile = texture/data/dirt.jpg]\n
-- size of this terrain in meters\n
Size = 533.3333\n
-- the height value read from the height map will be scaled by this factor.\n
ElevScale = 1.0\n
-- whether the image is vertically swapped. It takes effects on gray-scale height map image\n
Swapvertical = 1\n
-- hight resolution radius, within which the terrain is drawn in detail.this is optional.\n
[HighResRadius = 30]\n
-- we will use a LOD block to approximate the terrain at its location, if the block is smaller than fDetailThreshold pixels when projected to the 2D screen. \n

* @section format_tiledconfig File Format: Latticed Terrain Configuration
*
Lattice Terrain Specification. (pay attention to spaces between characters).
It consists of the size of a terrain tile and a mapping from tile position to 
their single terrain configuration file. Please note the first line "type = lattice" is mandatory, otherwise
it will be mistreated as a single terrain configuration.
if there are multiple single configuration files for the same tile position, the first one will be used.
if there are multiple tile positions referring the same single terrain configuration file, copies of the same terrain will be created at these tile positions

type = lattice\n
TileSize = 533.333\n
-- tile0_0.txt refers to a single terrain configuration file.\n
(0,0) = terrain/data/tile0_0.txt\n
(2,2) = terrain/data/tile2_2.txt\n
(3,3) = terrain/data/tile3_3.txt\n
(4,2) = terrain/data/tile4_2.txt\n
* \n
* @section format_elevation File Format: Para-Raw Terrain Elevation file
*
The file name must end with ".raw", for example. in the single terrain configuration file:
Heightmapfile = terrain/data/LlanoElev.raw\n
the engine will assume that the elevation file is of RAW terrain elevation, otherwise it is treated as 
a gray scale image. In a gray scale image RGB(0.5,0.5,0.5) is of height 0. However, gray scale image has 
only 8-bits levels, which is insufficient for most application. That is why I implemented the RAW terrain 
Elevation file.
\n
The content of RAW elevation file is just a buffer of "float[nSize][nSize]", 
please note that nSize must be power of 2 or power of 2 plus 1. i.e. 
nSize = (2*...*2) | (2*...*2+1);
* \n
* @section change_log Changes
*
The following things are changed in ParaEngine during porting:
(1) The latticed terrain engine is fully implemented.
(2) RAW elevation file of (2*2*...*2+1) quad sized height map is supported.
(3) Latticed configuration file is implemented. 
(4) Single terrain configuration file is implemented.
(5) HAPI CreateWorld is added. Quad tree depth is now automatically calculated.
(6) Blank Terrain now defaults to a plane at y=0.
(7) WoW terrain exporter implemented.
(8) Global Report class support string value now and it internally uses map instead of list for all reporting items.
(9) Latticed terrain rendering is now reported.
(10) A detailed (none tessellation radius) is added. 
(11) Tiled (or latticed)terrain objects are dynamically loaded into memory and automatically cached. 
(12) No cracks between terrain tiles. 
(13) detail texture logic has been moved to the tessellation process.
(14) The latticed terrain cache uses an indexed map, which hashes (x,y) to an integer. x,y can be any integer(negative is OK)
(15) Gray scale image is still supported. RGB(0.5,0.5,0.5) is regarded as 0 height.
(16) ParaObject::SetPosition(), now y height is relative to world coordinate system.
(17) The biped object is only normalized to terrain surface along the facing direction.
(18) TODO:there is a bug with the free-mode camera
- high-res texture tile is implemented. High res texture will be be dynamically loaded and deleted due to the camera view location.
high-res texture usually has 16 or 32 times resolution than the low-res texture. The low-res texture is always persistent in 
system memory;whereas high resolution textures are dynamically loaded and deleted from the system memory(also video memory). 
A system cache for high-res textures is maintained. A hit count/miss is recorded with each cached texture. The total number of 
cached high-res textures in memory is a constant, such as 40. Old textures are unloaded according to its hit count in the last 
32 render frames, when the cache is full. There is a mechanism to prevent current used textures to be unloaded (in case that 
all cached textures are being used simultaneously). 
- it is important that high-res textures are also tilable, otherwise there will be noticeable seams between tiles.
- texture coordinates are no longer generated, but computed at runtime.
- chopped texture are no longer flipped, because I use texture coordinates larger than 1 for tiling.
- Internally file system uses "boost 1.32.0". Currently, there are two boost version used in ParaEngine. 
the file system is linked as static library. It automatically select the release or debug version to link.
The boost build system takes quite sometime to build. and I have put the boost 1.32.0 install directory to the boost folders. 
- TODO: I want to use bump mapping for high-res textures. But it seems lots of work for the artists. 
Please refer to the terrain document 1.14. Emboss bump mapping may be used. But a more general UV bump mapping (bump/light maps)
with reflective surfaces may be supported in future version.
- A terrain buffer is used which is only rebuilt when the camera view is changed. 
- The terrain rendering has been further optimized by using a sorted set for texture grouping.

- A sort by texture group is performed before rendering each texture cell. As a 
result, we have to use triangular lists instead of triangular strips or fans. 
- Texture and elevation file loader now uses D3DX texture functions.
- Multi-texture is used when rendering the terrain with common and detailed textures.
- Norm rendering with light can be enabled by defining _USE_NORMAL_ in config file.
the terrain can also look very good when rendering with fog even if norm is not enabled.
Norm consume much memory, so it is disabled by default.
- see the config file for MAX_NUM_VISIBLE_TERRAIN_TRIANGLES. i.e. the maximum number 
of triangles to be rendered each frame. there will be cracks on the terrain if the number
of needed terrain triangles exceed this number. typically you can set this value to a very
large value.
- See the render() function for more information. 
- use the default render state and the following for better effect
m_pd3dDevice->SetSamplerState( 0, D3DSAMP_MINFILTER, D3DTEXF_LINEAR );
m_pd3dDevice->SetSamplerState( 0, D3DSAMP_MAGFILTER, D3DTEXF_LINEAR );
m_pd3dDevice->SetSamplerState( 1, D3DSAMP_MINFILTER, D3DTEXF_LINEAR );
m_pd3dDevice->SetSamplerState( 1, D3DSAMP_MAGFILTER, D3DTEXF_LINEAR );
-  When loading the terrain the elevation scale means the distance between the highest terrain
position and the lowest. the lowest is always 0. 
- enable WIRED_TERRAIN in config to render terrain in wires
-  Ray tracing has been completely changed so that it is computed at runtime, no memory 
consumption is needed. It might be a little slower than the original Demeter implementation,
but is sufficiently fast for several times per frame calling rate.
-  Original Demeter uses the z axis as the height, yet the para engine uses y axis. When doing
tessellation and rendering, I secretly swaps y and z when building the vertex data and doing
point projection and view culling. In this way, the terrain engine and the other paraengine uses
their own coordinate system.
-  The original Demeter culling function has been removed, instead it now uses the para engine's own
camera culling functions
-  Texture set has not been implemented yet. Please see the comment in render()
-  InitDevice and DeleteDevice are added. All texture data are preserved in memory. So that reloading
is very fast when the user changes its D3D device object. However, isEditor() must be set to true.
-  extern d3d device pointer is used to access the device.
-  m_TessellateZWeight = 200000; I still do not understand very well about this weight value.
so i changed it to 0.
