[The following text is taken from my bachelor thesis proposal]\n
In recent years, game engine related technology has drawn increasing academic attention from
a wide range of research areas. People come to realize that game engine may naturally evolve
in to the most widely used virtual reality platform in the future. The research framework
proposed in this paper is to exploit this possibility using established computer technologies
as well as newly designed ones. Current game engine framework already include solutions for a
large number of platform issues, such as real-time 3D visualization, physics simulation, event
and script system, path-finding, high-level decision making, networking, etc. However, the
computing paradigm behind it is usually constrained to a single platform, where a predefined
network topology must be explicitly constructed for cross-platform communications. My major
research goal is to redesign the computing paradigm to suit the need of highly dynamic networked
virtual environment, where intelligent entities are situated and communicate with each other
as well as human avatars. A complete distributed game engine framework will be proposed and
implemented with supporting game demos. Two areas of interest will be specialized with in-depth
study. One is the script programming environment and runtime for distributed game world logics;
the other is autonomous character animations in virtual game worlds.

The idea of distributed computer game engine can be pictured by drawing an analog with the current
World Wide Web. I.e. we compare web pages to 3D game worlds; hyperlinks and services in web pages
to active objects in 3D game worlds; and web browsers and client/server side runtime environments
to computer game engines. However, in distributed game world, interactions among entities will be
more intensive and extensive, such as several characters exchanging messages at real time; game world
logic will be more distributed, with each node being a potential server, and also more dynamic,
with different nodes forming temporary or long lasting relationships.
