	/**
	It uses architecture proposed by the content streaming sample in DirectX 9&10

	Three types of threads come into play. 
	- The first is the render thread. The render thread's main job is to draw the scene without stalling. 
		Lesser jobs of the rendering thread include sending I/O requests to the I/O thread by way of the request queue, 
		and handling lock and unlock requests from the I/O thread. To keep the render thread from stalling, both of these lesser jobs are handled when it is convenient for the render thread. 
	- The second type of thread is the I/O thread. The I/O thread handles requests from the render thread. 
		It also either loads files from the packed file or gets memory-mapped pointers to them. 
		The I/O thread handles communications with the various process threads and also places lock/unlock requests into the lock/unlock queue for consumption by the render thread. 
		In addition, on Direct3D 9, the I/O thread does the actual copying of bits into the device object. 
		There is generally one I/O thread for each storage device that will be used on the system. 

	- The last type of thread is the process thread. Process threads handle the dirty work of processing the data after it has been loaded from disk by the I/O thread. 
		Process threads can decompress data, prefetch data when using memory-mapped I/O, or handle other operations, such as swizzling, 
		that may need to be performed on the data before it is copied into the device object. 
		There should generally be a single process thread for each available hardware thread. 

	The typical chain of events is as follows: 
		1.The I/O thread and the process threads are sleeping, waiting for something to do. The graphics thread is rendering away.
		2.The graphics thread determines that a resource is going to be visible sometime in the near future. It places a resource request on the request queue.
		3.The I/O thread picks this request up and loads the data from the packed file or download from network. 
		4.The I/O thread then sends a process request to one of the waiting process threads. 
			The processing thread performs some computation on the data. Such as checking for integrity and decompression. 
		5.When the process thread is done processing, it puts a lock request into the lock/unlock queue of the render thread.
		6.When the render thread feels like it, it picks up the lock request, and locks the resource.
		7.The render thread then sends the request back to the I/O thread. On Direct3D 9, the I/O thread copies the data into the device object.
		8.Then the I/O thread puts an unlock request in the lock/unlock queue.
		9.When the render thread feels like it, it picks up the unlock request and unlocks the resource. The resource is now ready to use.
