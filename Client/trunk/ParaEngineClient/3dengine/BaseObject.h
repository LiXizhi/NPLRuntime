/** object volume bit fields
* here is some example:\n
* scene root:		OBJ_VOLUMN_ISOLATED | OBJ_VOLUMN_FREESPACE
* floor/terrain:	OBJ_VOLUMN_ISOLATED | OBJ_VOLUMN_FREESPACE | OBJ_VOLUMN_CONTAINER
* biped:			OBJ_VOLUMN_SENSOR
* dummy:			[OBJ_VOLUMN_SENSOR]		e.g. Like walls, chairs, gate, monitors/sensors
* skybox:			OBJ_VOLUMN_ISOLATED | OBJ_VOLUMN_FREESPACE
* house:			OBJ_VOLUMN_CONTAINER | OBJ_VOLUMN_FREESPACE
* houseWalls:		see dummy.

View culling principles:\n
1.draw obj only when it's in the view sphere
2.do not draw child nodes of a container if the container is out of the view
3.When object is in view, we will not draw the _House object itself, if the player is
in this _House.  However, we will draw the inside content of this _House. If it's not 
a house container, both this object and its child nodes are drawn.
4.When object is in view, we will draw the container object, but not its child 
nodes, if the player is not in the container.

Collision detection principles:\n
1. add to collision pair only if it's a sensor.
2. child nodes are also tested if the player is in OBJ_VOLUMN_FREESPACE | OBJ_VOLUMN_CONTAINER
3. do not need to check the child of contain if the container does not contains the object

/**
* Defines the base class of all scene elements:CBaseObject for Parallel World 
*		 Engine. It is generally an abstract class, which means that it doe snot contain
*		 data structure. However, it provides many virtual functions that may be called 
*		 many times by other modules(such as Environment Simulator and AI Simulator ), 
*       so that inherited class could has their own implementations. 
*
*		 The virtual functions falls into several class:
*       (1) object property query: like position, facing, radius,height, volume type, etc.
*       (2) object collision detection: like TestCollisionObject, TestCollisionSphere, etc.
*           it only contains functions that carry out the actual collision detection, NOT
*           implementing any collision detection algorithm in large scale.
*       (3) frame move: Animate(). Note this is only implemented by [meta]biped and sceneRoot objects
*           which will actually handle events. All other scene objects' frame move will 
*           be handled by classes other than their own. Those classes may be 
*           environment simulator and game Interface and Rule controller.
*       (4) Rendering: Almost all object use Draw() method to render itself. Some objects
*           like Biped needs an additional AdvanceTime(). Since most of the time draw()
*           method only draws a static scene, while AdvanceTime() will advance the animation
*           frame used by an animation based object. Some animated object like Sprite does not
*           have this AdvanceTime(); this is either because the frame advance needs very little
*           computation time or its animation frame doe snot need to be precise. So Sprite object
*           is treated like a static object, and it doe snot have AdvanceTime() like other animated
*           ones.
*
*       Base object class also kept common and shared data structures and functions
*       (1) Object Type and Identifier
*       (2) tree nodes management: m_children
*       (3) Event management
*
* Note: It is not suggested to have too many inherited class of this class in depth,
*		 because it will induce too many data space waste. As you may see, I have used
*		 as few data words as possible in this set of classes.
* Note[2004/5/3]:  All inherited object should deallocate anything in the Cleanup() which is
*    called by the destructor of the BaseObject. Because the destruction of any inherited class
*    are not guaranteed to be called when it's deleted. Pay attention to any member object like(string)
*    which may depends on the destructor to release its resources.
