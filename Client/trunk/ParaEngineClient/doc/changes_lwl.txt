BUG 2006/8/1: when switching characters, the attribute window content scroll bar position changes. 

2006/7/27 TODO: fix the Z-order of highlighting and what if container size does not fully contain the highlight animation

//TODO:[LiXizhi]2006/5/3
(1) I do not know if following is bug: Multiple EM_MOUSEMOVE will be generated in a single frame, where dx,dy is (0,0). 
	Moreover, at 20-27 FPS, EM_MOUSEMOVE will lose accuracy significantly. So I resolve to the old method for getting mouse delta:GetMouseXDeltaSteps().
(2) alpha testing is enabled for GUI control? Ask YZL for the transparency problem
	
	
TODO: Implement the following modifier dialog. 
	- DummyNPCRandomWalker: on "CRpgCharacter" : make the current NPC a dummy NPC walking randomly in a given radius. GUI Parameter: radius. 
		Comments: Just devise long enough sequence to make it look random. Use sequence controller in the On_Load event handler. Use database field state0 and state1 to retrieve parameter.
	- DummyNPCSimpleDialog: on "CRpgCharacter": A traditional NPC in RPG game, when clicked will talk a string to the user. 
	- DummyNPCParaEngine: An NPC that introduces ParaEngine. 

TODO: add CGUIProfile:IAttributeField: so that the script can set the default texture set for all kinds of controls. 
	such as {button100_30, button50_10, editbox100_30, editbox50_20, etc...}
	implement IAttributeField in CGUIProfile. CGUIProfile can be initially implemented as a singleton, 
	but all CGUIBase may has a member pointer of this type, which always initially point to the singleton object(the default CGUIProfile).
	This is useful in the multiple demos we will build, since most of the time, we can modify the appearance of a group of GUI by just modifying their shared CGUIProfile object. 
2006/7/28
- finish "NstageAnimation" effect. This effect will change displaying image from none, stage1, .... stagen, none......
  It has parameter "speed"(time interval for changing stage to next stage, in second)
  "size" the number of stages.
    

2006/7/27
- finish highlight effect framework for nealy all kinds of 2d GUI objects. To use the framework, set object.highlightstyle="4outsideArrow" for a special effect or "none" for no effect.
  use ParaUI.SetHighlightParam(effectName, paramName, paramValue) to set parameters of an effect
- finish "4outsideArrow" effect for 2d objects. It has parameter "speed" and "range"
  "speed" is a float and range [0,1]
  "range" is an int and range [0, infinity);

2006/7/26
- finish GUICanvas, .background of the GUICanvas is the mask of the 3d displayed object. So artist need to provide a mask image.
2006/7/24
- now "_m?" alignment type work in any situation. When, for example, ctrl.alignment = "_mt", then if parent.width<ctrl.left+ctrl.right, the ctrl will display in a place
  where left=parent.right-ctrl.right, right=parent.left+ctrl.left
- add GUICanvas to support displaying 3d object in a gui control. Not tested, waiting for the 3d interface.

2006/7/20
- scrollbar with new property "fixedthumb"(bool) and "thumbsize"(int) available. "thumbsize" only useful when fixedthumb=true
- scrollbar can be binded to a container as a seperate control, you only need to set "scrollbar:SetBindingObj(containerObj);"
  Then you can use the scrollbar to scroll a container. You need to use scrollbar:SetTrackRange(start,end) scrollbar:SetPageSize(size) to 
  make the scrollbar work properly.

- onchange event will trigger only if ismodified==true
- editbox.text property will not make ismodified true
- add container.popup property. if a container.popup is set true, the container will automatically get input focus. when it lost focus, it will destroy itself.
  container.candrag will be set false if popup is set true. one should first attach a container to root or other object before setting popup.
  Example: 
  --create a container name a
  a:AttachToRoot();
  a.popup=true;

2006/6/5

2006/3/10

- finish a CGraphBuilder class, which is used to provide an interface for play and control a video file
- known problems on the above class:
  1. The performance is bound to the codec you installed on the system.
  2. Sometimes the output is not correct. In most cases, its your codec's fault. Try to install the correct codec and restart the system. 
  3. All known problems on my machine are: Popping up a new window instead of playing the content in the place you want. 
     Unable to debug when using certain kind of codec. Crash unexpectedly.

2006/2/20
- new clipping method--using scissor rectangle-- introduced, results are as good as the old way of stencil buffer, but performance is much the same as rectangle clip.

2006/2/16
- disabled stencil buffer, use rectangle clip instead, greatly improved performance, especially when using a lot of not-fastrender containers.

2006/2/14
- TODO: Lua interface:
        1. debug information must not be a block of unknown characters --done
        2. report misuse of functions and parameters.

2005/12/19
- Add highlight support to tooltip, use ParaUI.GetToolTip() to get the tooltip instance. Then use its properties "automaticdelay", "autopopdelay", "initialdelay" and "behavior".
  Use its function "Highlight(parauiobject, text)" to highlight an object. Highlight will only appear once on an object. It is auto-deleted afterwards.
TODO: the lua can't correctly interpert a wrong input parameter. For instance, sending a int to a char* parameter. The lua can't stop the operation and the 
receiver function receive an int but it thinks it is a char *. So the function will go wrong and the function has nothing to do with it.

- add several performance monitor functions. To use them, compile with _PERFORMANCE_MONITOR definition. Use PERF_BEGIN(countername) to start a counter
  PERF_END(countername) to end a counter, the time span between BEGIN and END will be recorded. The same counter can be BEGIN and END several times and 
  the data will be accumulated to form a final report by calling PERF_REPORT(). The report is written to perf.txt in the working directory.
