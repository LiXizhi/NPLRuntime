	/**
	* a global pool for user registered custom events. 
	* see events page for information about events parameters in scripting interface.
	* events are categorized by types, see PE_types.h, events_def.h. There are also some predefined events in Predefinedevents.h.
	
	Global ParaEngine event handlers are exposed through scripting interface, API interface, and managed API interface. 
	Managed API interface are exposed as multi-cast delegate in the EventCenter class of ParaEngineManaged class.

	Two types of event firing are supported:
		(1) Fire event immediately, similar to SendMessage in Win32 
		(2) Pose Event, which return immediate without executing the event handlers. similar to PostMessages in Win32
	Since event raisers and event handlers may be in the same thread, PoseEvent is there to prevent interlocking of program code. 
	
	Example:  SelectionToolWindow in ParaIDE are implemented through the new managed event handling interface. Whenever the game engine changes selection, 
	the plug-in interface will receive an event, and in the event handler, it will update the GUI to reflect the recent changes in selection.
